JavaScript is one of the most widely-used programming languages for frontend web development on the planet. Developed by Microsoft, TypeScript serves as a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript that aims to extend the language, make it more user-friendly, and apply to modern development. TypeScript is an open source language and can be used on nearly any platform (Linux, macOS, and Windows).

TypeScript is an object-oriented language that includes features like class, interface, Arrow functions, ambient declaration, and class inheritance. Some of the advantages of using TypeScript include:

1. Runs on any browser or JavaScript engine.
2. Uses the same syntax as JavaScript and all TypeScript code is converted into JavaScript.
3. TypeScript code can be called from existing JavaScript code.
4. Works with existing JavaScript frameworks.
5. Provides support for JavaScript libraries.
6. Supports the latest JavaScript features.
7. Easy integration with third-party tools.
8. Fewer runtime errors.
9. Better code quality and documentation

Some of the features that TypeScript offers over JavaScript include:

1. Optional static typing
2. Readability
3. Vast IDE Support
4. Object-Oriented Programming
5. Support for the latest ECMAScript features

One of the biggest advantages of using TypeScript is that it offers a robust environment to help you spot errors in your code as you type. This feature can dramatically cut down on testing and debugging time, which means you can deliver working code faster.

Ultimately, TypeScript is best used to build and manage large-scale JavaScript projects. It is neither a frontend nor backend language, but a means to extend the feature set of JavaScript.
